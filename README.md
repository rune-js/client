# RuneJS Client

The RuneJS Client is a very much work-in-progress custom TypeScript game client for RuneJS servers. The application is written using Electron as the base.

This client is not yet operational, please use the [RuneScape Java Client #435](https://github.com/rune-js/refactored-client-435) in the meantime.
